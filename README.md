cutiemarkcrusaders.club
=======================

TL;DR Simply put, this is the repository for the cutiemarkcrusaders.club domain. This is a website designed by
members of the Bronies Australia community.

If you are a part of the BAU community and would like to make a commit to the repo, have a look through the files,
find what you'd like to change, and change it. It won't be pushed unless I approve it, so don't get any ideas.

Any questions should be directed to me: joshua.peckover@live.com.au or shoot me a PM on BAu.
