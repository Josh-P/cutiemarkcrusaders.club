cutiemarkcrusaders.club
=======================

TL;DR Simply put, this is the repository for the cutiemarkcrusaders.club domain. This is a website designed by
members of the Bronies Australia community.

If you are a part of the BAU community and would like to make a commit to the repo, click "Fork" up in the top right to clone the repository to your own account (requires github account) and make changes by either using the built in text-editor or by downloading the files individually and changing them that way (do this by using Notepad++ or Sublime Text 3). You can then make a "pull request" which can be approved by me, at which point it will be added to the site. If I trust you enough, I'll add you as a collaborator and you won't need me to approve your changes.

Any questions should be directed to me: joshua.peckover@live.com.au or shoot me a PM on BAu.
